            <h2>Things I've worked on</h2>
                <p>As an inveterate technology generalist, I've got a track record in seeing the forest <em>and</em> the trees. I'm good at understand the promise of a technology, and how it fits into the bigger picture. I think my career development reflects this!</p>
            <h3>Hotjar -- Product Support Specialist</h3>
                <p>Starting out in the Customer Support team back in 2018, when we were still being called Customer Heros, my initial remit was simple: help users get the most out of Hotjar!</p>
                <p>During 2019 My experience with content development made me ideally placed for helping with the task of writing content for the knowledge base.</p>
                <p>As 2020 came around, I was partnered up with the recordings team, as a Product Support Specialist charged with making sure the Support team was ready and able to provide support for this crucial piece of the product. I routinely help inform the product team of user frustrations, helping to inform the direction of the product. </p>
            <h3>Manning Publications Co. -- Acquisition Editor</h3>
                <p>As one of the best loved publishers of books on software development, I was responsible for commissioning books across a wide range of products. I researched the market, and sourced authors. A year or so into my time at Manning, I was made responsible for leading Manning's initial charge into video course production: almost all of its initial range of videos were commissioned by me. I was never been able to tally up the final totals, and a lot of my best products were published after I finished at Manning but I'm reasonably sure products I commissioned generated maybe a couple of million dollars over their lifetimes.</p>
            <h3>Packt Publishing -- Acquisition Editor</h3>
                <p>Here's where my professional career really began. I learned the art of commissioning books, and I really developed an appreciation for the software industry. In my time at Packt, I worked on around 100 books, over the course of just under 2 years.</p>
            <h3>University of Nottingham -- Masters Degree - <em>Social and Global Justice</em> - Merit</h3>
                <p>Studying in the department of Politics and International relations, I focused primarily on studying the politics of revolution, rebellion, and civil war. With a dissertation dissecting the role of technology on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 during the Arab Spring, I truly began to appreciate the transformative power of technology.</p>
            <h3>University of Reading -- Bachelor's  Degree - <em>Ancient History</em> - First Class</h3>
                <p>I've always been a history nerd. Here I focused some of the less well known sub-groups of Ancient Greece, such as Macedon, Thessaly, and Epirus.</p>
