In the end it took a little longer, due to some unforseen complications about how I misunderstood how Next/React handles data.\r\n\r\nIn short, I'd hoped that I would be able to add a quick sort function to the PostList component that renders the blog articles in list form. It proved to be a little more complicated than I expected. The components would only accept serializable content (i.e. something that converts to JSON). The problem was, I was trying to convert my dates to a JavaScript date object, and pass that through the components. This wasn't going to work!\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had to add the code to the blog page component. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was write a quick function to take the post data, and use the date string from the markdown headers such as \"2020-11-17\", and convert this to a Date Object.\r\n\r\n    const postsWithDatesConverted = postsRaw =\u003e {\r\n        return postsRaw.map(post =\u003e {\r\n            post.frontmatter.date = new Date(post.frontmatter.date);\r\n            return post;\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext I needed to sort by date - without it, the list would appear in an order that made no sense at all. An interesting issue I ran into was mutating the data in place when using sort. This again lead to a strange looking sort. To prevent this, a `slice()` of the whole array returns a copy of it for us to work with. Finally, I needed to reverse the array to prevent it being sorted oldest-first.\r\n\r\n    const postsSorted = postsWithDatesConverted(postsRaw)\r\n        .slice()\r\n        .sort((a, b) =\u003e a.frontmatter.date - b.frontmatter.date)\r\n        .reverse()\r\n\r\nFinally, to prevent the problem I mentioned with the components requiring serializable content, I converted the date to a string - I only wanted the date information anyway!\r\n\r\n    const posts = postsSorted.map(post =\u003e {\r\n        post.frontmatter.date = post.frontmatter.date.toISOString().slice(0,10)\r\n        return post\r\n    })\r\n\r\n[Check out the git commit](https://github.com/gregjwild/gregjw-site/commit/d0318643b73c2411bc1159edd996624c21fcb460) if you're interested in seeing the rest of the site's code.","slug":"adding-sort-by-date-to-blog"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"The obligatory post about my blog's rewrite","date":"2020-11-16","status":"draft","summary":"I rewrote the blog in Next.js"},"markdownBody":"\r\n\u003e Most importantly, it's a place to start publishing writing, which is above and beyond the vital role of a blog!\r\n\r\nThus said Greg in... September last year. I then promptly failed to write anything. Time to fix that, and of course, I decided to start by rewriting the blog engine. \r\n\r\nSomething that frustrated me with using Gatsby for the blog last time around was the extra layers of headache I needed to consider. Graph QL was the main one, especially as I want to start adding other types of content to gregjw.com, as well as blog articles. \r\n\r\nEverything holds true of my requirements before. For the reader that means:\r\n- They should be clean and easy to read.\r\n- They should load fast.\r\n- No ads.\r\n- Navigation should be easy.\r\n\r\nFor me:\r\n- They should be easy to add content to.\r\n- I'd like to have the ability to add more bespoke pages to the site over time, particularly allowing me to use D3.js for data visualization.\r\n- I'd like to minimize the amount of clientside JS where possible.\r\n- I'd like to actually understand the tech stack. I am not a great software engineer, and troubleshooting problems is not my forteit.\r\n\r\nI think the rewrite helps more with me. Based on the way Next has a server compared with Gatsby (which just generates a static site for me), I've got more freedom. I also feel like there are fewer layers of abstraction to understand with Next: it's basically just an opinionated React framework, so if I understand React, I should be able to understand Next. So far, misunderstandings have been minor.","slug":"obligatory-about-the-rewrite"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Don't learn to code! (Well, maybe don't.)","date":"2020-11-14","status":"draft","summary":"There are a whole range of jobs in tech that don't require that you become a software engineer."},"markdownBody":"Way back in the early 2010s, I seriously considered doing a _2nd_ Masters degree in Computer Science. Why? I wanted a job in tech to help me get out of a dead-end bar job. After a BA in _Ancient History_, and an MA in _Social and Global Justice_ (aka politics), I was convinced I'd made all the wrong decisions. As far as my perspective taught me, a good job in tech required a CS education.p;[] After a personal crisis left me with no dead-end job and 1 month of rent money in the bank, I didn't have the luxury of considering further further education. To cut things short, I got lucky! I managed to land myself a job as an Acquisitions Editor at a local publishing house who specialised in programming books. \r\n\r\nAround this time, the quality of (often free) online training about programming increased massively. I learned the basic web-stack, and experimented with various programming languages. My job afforded me the opportunity to understand which technical skills were high value. Over time I continued to develop programming skills in web development and data analysis. After 5 years as a book editor, I was convinced I should get a _technical_ job. I eventually joined the customer support team at Hotjar.\r\n\r\nHere's where things got interesting. I'd sort of seen the role as a potential route into a software engineering job. I've seen colleagues make that jump, so I wasn't wrong. What I quickly learned though, is that the range of jobs available in the software engineering world are much more diverse than you think. As long as you're not the kind of person who enjoys physical labour for a living, there's probably a job for you in a software company.\r\n\r\n","slug":"dont-learn-to-code"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Digital Minimalism, by Cal Newport","date":"2019-09-24","status":"published","summary":"Cal Newport makes a powerful case for reducing your use of digital products."},"markdownBody":"\r\nI'm convinced that at some point his editor probably encouraged Cal Newport to call *Digital Minimalism* 'Deep Leisure'. Newport sets out a manifesto for living in control of technology, rather than letting technology control you.  To anyone who has read *Deep Work*, Newport's focus on, well, focus, will find his new book familiar.  This time, he takes aim at your leisure time, conceding early on that digital tools you need for work are not optional. It's a book about intentional, rather than compulsive use of technology. It's about creation over consumption.  \r\n\r\nThe greatest challenge initially is Newport's prescription for a cold turkey period. A 'digital declutter' where you go 30 days living without technology as much as possible without risking your career. That period of radical disassociation from technology is needed to to embrace the minimalist philosophy. Basking in the warm glow of the Majorcan sun while reading, it all felt very sensible, and even somewhat achievable. As you can imagine, touching down back in Britain, the silicon tendrils of technology quickly found themselves taking hold once again.\r\n\r\nNewport's manifesto begins by taking aim at the nature of the beast. Drawing on the work of big tech whistle-blowers such as Tristan Harris, Newport explores the fact that modern software companies treat addiction as carefully engineered design features. Who am I to argue? I've got a copy of Nir Eyal's *Hooked* sat right next to me as I write this review. Newport points out that this is especially relevant to phone app users. Of course, Facebook comes under particular heat. Avoiding the use of such apps is a big step in the right direction. Newport himself claims not to use them. Nor do I, but I'd find it hard to argue I don't have a technology addiction.\r\n\r\nThrough and through, I accept I'm an internet addict. I'm not a big smartphone user, but I *am* hooked on the web. I'm a news junkie, and I can rarely go more than a waking hour without hurriedly refreshing my tabs to see what's breaking in my areas of interest. Similarly, as a big PC gamer long since hooked on the drip feed of *absurdly* cheap games, I'm more than familiar with the classic choice paralysis that comes with having access to literally hundreds of video games. I was highly conscious of - and looking to change this - before reading *Digital Minimalism*, but it has given form and structure to the problem for me. \r\n\r\nNewport bases much of his book on an experiment he ran using volunteers who signed up for his prescription. An early finding, was that sans notifications, and the drip-feed of passive content, his guinea pigs became *bored*. They quickly found themselves with time to fill. Newport focuses on stories of his volunteers finding more active, fulfilling activities to occupy their leisure time. It is this distinction between \"passive\" and \"active\" leisure that gets to the heart the problem. Being active and intentional about your time is what liberates you from technology. He frames reliance on technology a *consumption* activity, rather than a *creation* activity. \r\n\r\nDeep leisure means for a more intentional, creative time spent cultivating yourself. Newport offers a raft of interesting approaches. This could mean taking up some kind of craft activity, engaging in more active social activities, or even just taking long walks. This struck a chord. I've felt for some time that regular routines are more about consumption than creation. Some of the activities suggested were very close to things I've often thought I'd like to take up.\r\n\r\nI appreciate a great deal of Newport's book, though I do think it's flawed in some of the examples he draws on. David Thoreau is a side character for much of the book. He's someone whose broadly anarchist view on life has interested me in the past. The challenging thing is that Thoreau is principally well known for his philosophy of material parsimony. This was born out of returning to basics, and giving up \"work\" as we conventionally think about it for a life of simple living in nature. When your leisure time is limited, you have to choose your activities wisely. \r\n \r\nNewport also draws on the example of the so-called \"financially independent\". Basically, they're people who have earned enough money they can give up work and are forced to find new ways to entertain themselves. Such as taking a chainsaw to the acres of tangled undergrowth on their property. It can be hard to relate. In fairness, these are deliberately extreme examples to show how extensive amounts of leisure time requires that you find other fulfilling activity. Regardless, you can't help but wonder if the lessons are hard to apply to those of us who spend a third of every day working, a third sleeping, with a third remaining for the rest of life's chores (and some leisure).\r\n\r\nI also feel Newport is not quite charitable enough about *some* shallow leisure in your life. The problem with active \"doing\" is that when you get right down to it, you've only got so many mental and physical reserves to spend on activity. Everyone needs a little down time, even if that means consuming someone else's creative output. After all, if everyone was too busy doing their own thing, who's going to appreciate the stuff worth sharing? \r\n\r\nCriticisms aside, I've been taking its lessons to heart since reading. While I wasn't prepared for the digital declutter, I have started trying to live life more intentionally. This cuts to the heart of what Newport feels the good life should be. The blog you're reading now is a testament to one of the \"active\" pursuits I've long been meaning to get started. Granted, Newport advises against doing something with technology in your leisure time, but I feel this misses the underlying point. I've also been researching how to get started with carpentry, for an activity that most certainly requires no technology. So, it's clearly helped form my thinking.\r\n\r\n*Digital Minimalism* is like any self-help book, though it's a pretty good one. It's hard not to see something of yourself in the criticism, and extreme adherence to it has something appealing about it. But perhaps, extreme adherence is not what's needed. If the worse thing to come out of reading it is that you spend a few hours less in front of a screen, and few more on getting to work on the things you want to *do* in life, then it's worth the effort. \r\n\r\nNow where did I put my phone?

Plot-twist! It's now using Next.js instead."},"markdownBody":"I seriously considered building this in pure HTML \u0026 CSS. Blogs should only ever be as complicated as they need to be. Requirements are simple:\r\n\r\nFor the reader:\r\n\r\n- They should be clean and easy to read.\r\n- They should load fast.\r\n- No ads. \r\n- Navigation should be easy.\r\n\r\nFor me:\r\n\r\n- They should be easy to add content to.\r\n- I'd like to have the ability to add more bespoke pages to the site over time, particularly allowing me to use D3.js for data visualization.\r\n- I'd like to minimize the amount of clientside JS where possible.\r\n- I'd like to actually understand the tech stack. I am not a great software engineer, and troubleshooting problems is not my forteit.\r\n\r\nHTML \u0026 CSS would have covered all of this, to an extent. The first of my requirements isn't too worrysome. It would have been easy enough to convert Markdown to HTML and just upload the new article as a new page on the site. The problem is, this came into conflict with one of my reader requirements: navigation should be easy. I didn't really want to add a table of contents page they would have to visit in order to change page, but rather some kind of menu. Updating that menu by hand every time I added an article would have been a burden. Of course, I've yet to add that menu, but it'll happen eventually.\r\n\r\n## Enter Gatsby \u0026 Netlify\r\n\r\nI didn't want to opt for a full blog engine like Wordpress or Ghost, so a static site generator (SSG hereafter) made sense. I know React, so using a React based SSG made sense. I'd also done a little with Gatsby before, so that reduced the cognitive burden further. Decision made. \r\n\r\nThe official Gatsby tutorial is a guide on how to build a blog, which I decided to follow through, since I'd not used Gatsby for a year or so, and felt like a refresher would be good. The main part that made me uncomfortable was the use of CSS in JS. While I'm by no means a CSS zealot, reducing the number of components in the stack to just things I understand warranted removing it. The principles are fairly simple, but in the end I decided to go with CSS modules.\r\n\r\nNow, for hosting. I didn't want a complicated tool chain. Anything that gave me `git push` to get content out there would work best. I considered AWS Amplify, and Netlify. Netlify won in the end purely on the grounds there are more tutorials for it. I don't expect tens of thousands of visitors any time soon, so this felt like a good choice, and one I think I could fairly easily change if needed down the line.\r\n\r\n## Current state\r\nRight now, there is a lot to improve on. I've got some layout ideas to develop, but it looks okay on mobile, tablets, and desktop devices for now. \r\n\r\nI haven't got any analytics on here currently. A few reasons why:\r\n\r\n- I'm probably not going to get much traffic for a while. Single digit daily page views are kind of a bummer, so I'll just pretend I'm bringing in the numbers.\r\n- I don't want to use Google Analytics. It's total overkill for a personal blog.\r\n- I don't really need to use any behavioral analytics right now, and I'm skeptical I ever will. Sorry about that, esteemed colleagues at Hotjar! \r\n- You don't need a privacy policy if you're not collecting private information. rollsafe.jpeg\r\n- I'll either need to pay for a service, or host one myself. \r\n\r\nStill, I'm totally not above having my ego stroked (let's face it, until you have something to sell, that's all personal blog analytics are about!), so if you're reading this and like it, follow me on [Twitter maybe](https://twitter.com/gregjwild). \r\n\r\nMost importantly, it's a place to start publishing writing, which is above and beyond the vital role of a blog!","slug":"obligatory-about-my-blogs-stack-post"}],"title":"Greg J.
