Why? I wanted a job in tech to help me get out of a dead-end bar job. After a BA in _Ancient History_, and an MA in _Social and Global Justice_ (aka politics), I was convinced I'd made all the wrong decisions. As far as my perspective taught me, a good job in tech required a CS education.p;[] After a personal crisis left me with no dead-end job and 1 month of rent money in the bank, I didn't have the luxury of considering further further education. To cut things short, I got lucky! I managed to land myself a job as an Acquisitions Editor at a local publishing house who specialised in programming books. \r\n\r\nAround this time, the quality of (often free) online training about programming increased massively. I learned the basic web-stack, and experimented with various programming languages. My job afforded me the opportunity to understand which technical skills were high value. Over time I continued to develop programming skills in web development and data analysis. After 5 years as a book editor, I was convinced I should get a _technical_ job. I eventually joined the customer support team at Hotjar.\r\n\r\nHere's where things got interesting. I'd sort of seen the role as a potential route into a software engineering job. I've seen colleagues make that jump, so I wasn't wrong. What I quickly learned though, is that the range of jobs available in the software engineering world are much more diverse than you think. As long as you're not the kind of person who enjoys physical labour for a living, there's probably a job for you in a software company.\r\n\r\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
