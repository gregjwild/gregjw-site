September last year. I then promptly failed to write anything. Time to fix that, and of course, I decided to start by rewriting the blog engine. \r\n\r\nSomething that frustrated me with using Gatsby for the blog last time around was the extra layers of headache I needed to consider. Graph QL was the main one, especially as I want to start adding other types of content to gregjw.com, as well as blog articles. \r\n\r\nEverything holds true of my requirements before. For the reader that means:\r\n- They should be clean and easy to read.\r\n- They should load fast.\r\n- No ads.\r\n- Navigation should be easy.\r\n\r\nFor me:\r\n- They should be easy to add content to.\r\n- I'd like to have the ability to add more bespoke pages to the site over time, particularly allowing me to use D3.js for data visualization.\r\n- I'd like to minimize the amount of clientside JS where possible.\r\n- I'd like to actually understand the tech stack. I am not a great software engineer, and troubleshooting problems is not my forteit.\r\n\r\nI think the rewrite helps more with me. Based on the way Next has a server compared with Gatsby (which just generates a static site for me), I've got more freedom. I also feel like there are fewer layers of abstraction to understand with Next: it's basically just an opinionated React framework, so if I understand React, I should be able to understand Next. So far, misunderstandings have been minor."},"__N_SSG":true}
