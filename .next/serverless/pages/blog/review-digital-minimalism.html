Newport sets out a manifesto for living in control of technology, rather than letting technology control you.  To anyone who has read <em>Deep Work</em>, Newport&#x27;s focus on, well, focus, will find his new book familiar.  This time, he takes aim at your leisure time, conceding early on that digital tools you need for work are not optional. It&#x27;s a book about intentional, rather than compulsive use of technology. It&#x27;s about creation over consumption.</p><p>The greatest challenge initially is Newport&#x27;s prescription for a cold turkey period. A &#x27;digital declutter&#x27; where you go 30 days living without technology as much as possible without risking your career. That period of radical disassociation from technology is needed to to embrace the minimalist philosophy. Basking in the warm glow of the Majorcan sun while reading, it all felt very sensible, and even somewhat achievable. As you can imagine, touching down back in Britain, the silicon tendrils of technology quickly found themselves taking hold once again.</p><p>Newport&#x27;s manifesto begins by taking aim at the nature of the beast. Drawing on the work of big tech whistle-blowers such as Tristan Harris, Newport explores the fact that modern software companies treat addiction as carefully engineered design features. Who am I to argue? I&#x27;ve got a copy of Nir Eyal&#x27;s <em>Hooked</em> sat right next to me as I write this review. Newport points out that this is especially relevant to phone app users. Of course, Facebook comes under particular heat. Avoiding the use of such apps is a big step in the right direction. Newport himself claims not to use them. Nor do I, but I&#x27;d find it hard to argue I don&#x27;t have a technology addiction.</p><p>Through and through, I accept I&#x27;m an internet addict. I&#x27;m not a big smartphone user, but I <em>am</em> hooked on the web. I&#x27;m a news junkie, and I can rarely go more than a waking hour without hurriedly refreshing my tabs to see what&#x27;s breaking in my areas of interest. Similarly, as a big PC gamer long since hooked on the drip feed of <em>absurdly</em> cheap games, I&#x27;m more than familiar with the classic choice paralysis that comes with having access to literally hundreds of video games. I was highly conscious of - and looking to change this - before reading <em>Digital Minimalism</em>, but it has given form and structure to the problem for me.</p><p>Newport bases much of his book on an experiment he ran using volunteers who signed up for his prescription. An early finding, was that sans notifications, and the drip-feed of passive content, his guinea pigs became <em>bored</em>. They quickly found themselves with time to fill. Newport focuses on stories of his volunteers finding more active, fulfilling activities to occupy their leisure time. It is this distinction between &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; leisure that gets to the heart the problem. Being active and intentional about your time is what liberates you from technology. He frames reliance on technology a <em>consumption</em> activity, rather than a <em>creation</em> activity.</p><p>Deep leisure means for a more intentional, creative time spent cultivating yourself. Newport offers a raft of interesting approaches. This could mean taking up some kind of craft activity, engaging in more active social activities, or even just taking long walks. This struck a chord. I&#x27;ve felt for some time that regular routines are more about consumption than creation. Some of the activities suggested were very close to things I&#x27;ve often thought I&#x27;d like to take up.</p><p>I appreciate a great deal of Newport&#x27;s book, though I do think it&#x27;s flawed in some of the examples he draws on. David Thoreau is a side character for much of the book. He&#x27;s someone whose broadly anarchist view on life has interested me in the past. The challenging thing is that Thoreau is principally well known for his philosophy of material parsimony. This was born out of returning to basics, and giving up &quot;work&quot; as we conventionally think about it for a life of simple living in nature. When your leisure time is limited, you have to choose your activities wisely.</p><p>Newport also draws on the example of the so-called &quot;financially independent&quot;. Basically, they&#x27;re people who have earned enough money they can give up work and are forced to find new ways to entertain themselves. Such as taking a chainsaw to the acres of tangled undergrowth on their property. It can be hard to relate. In fairness, these are deliberately extreme examples to show how extensive amounts of leisure time requires that you find other fulfilling activity. Regardless, you can&#x27;t help but wonder if the lessons are hard to apply to those of us who spend a third of every day working, a third sleeping, with a third remaining for the rest of life&#x27;s chores (and some leisure).</p><p>I also feel Newport is not quite charitable enough about <em>some</em> shallow leisure in your life. The problem with active &quot;doing&quot; is that when you get right down to it, you&#x27;ve only got so many mental and physical reserves to spend on activity. Everyone needs a little down time, even if that means consuming someone else&#x27;s creative output. After all, if everyone was too busy doing their own thing, who&#x27;s going to appreciate the stuff worth sharing?</p><p>Criticisms aside, I&#x27;ve been taking its lessons to heart since reading. While I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the digital declutter, I have started trying to live life more intentionally. This cuts to the heart of what Newport feels the good life should be. The blog you&#x27;re reading now is a testament to one of the &quot;active&quot; pursuits I&#x27;ve long been meaning to get started. Granted, Newport advises against doing something with technology in your leisure time, but I feel this misses the underlying point.
